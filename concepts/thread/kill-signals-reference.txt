First the signals described in the original POSIX.1-1990 standard.

SIGALRM      14       Term    Timer signal from alarm(2)
SIGTERM      15       Term    Termination signal
SIGUSR1   30,10,16    Term    User-defined signal 1
SIGUSR2   31,12,17    Term    User-defined signal 2
SIGCHLD   20,17,18    Ign     Child stopped or terminated
SIGCONT   19,18,25    Cont    Continue if stopped
SIGSTOP   17,19,23    Stop    Stop process
SIGTSTP   18,20,24    Stop    Stop typed at terminal
SIGTTIN   21,21,26    Stop    Terminal input for background process
SIGTTOU   22,22,27    Stop    Terminal output for background process

The signals SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored.

Next  the  signals  not  in  the POSIX.1-1990 standard but described in
SUSv2 and POSIX.1-2001.

SIGBUS      10,7,10     Core    Bus error (bad memory access)
SIGPOLL                 Term    Pollable event (Sys V).
                                Synonym for SIGIO
SIGPROF     27,27,29    Term    Profiling timer expired
SIGSYS      12,31,12    Core    Bad argument to routine (SVr4)
SIGTRAP        5        Core    Trace/breakpoint trap
SIGURG      16,23,21    Ign     Urgent condition on socket (4.2BSD)
SIGVTALRM   26,26,28    Term    Virtual alarm clock (4.2BSD)
SIGXCPU     24,24,30    Core    CPU time limit exceeded (4.2BSD)
SIGXFSZ     25,25,31    Core    File size limit exceeded (4.2BSD)

Up to and including Linux 2.2, the default behavior for  SIGSYS,  SIGX‐
CPU,  SIGXFSZ,  and (on architectures other than SPARC and MIPS) SIGBUS
was to terminate the process (without a core  dump).   (On  some  other
UNIX systems the default action for SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ is to terminate
the  process  without  a  core  dump.)   Linux  2.4  conforms  to   the
POSIX.1-2001  requirements  for  these signals, terminating the process
with a core dump.

Next various other signals.

Signal       Value     Action   Comment
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SIGIOT         6        Core    IOT trap. A synonym for SIGABRT
SIGEMT       7,-,7      Term
SIGSTKFLT    -,16,-     Term    Stack fault on coprocessor (unused)
SIGIO       23,29,22    Term    I/O now possible (4.2BSD)
SIGCLD       -,-,18     Ign     A synonym for SIGCHLD
SIGPWR      29,30,19    Term    Power failure (System V)
SIGINFO      29,-,-             A synonym for SIGPWR
SIGLOST      -,-,-      Term    File lock lost (unused)
SIGWINCH    28,28,20    Ign     Window resize signal (4.3BSD, Sun)
SIGUNUSED    -,31,-     Core    Synonymous with SIGSYS

(Signal 29 is SIGINFO / SIGPWR on an alpha but SIGLOST on a sparc.)

SIGEMT is not specified in POSIX.1-2001, but  nevertheless  appears  on
most  other UNIX systems, where its default action is typically to ter‐
minate the process with a core dump.

SIGPWR (which is not specified in POSIX.1-2001) is typically ignored by
default on those other UNIX systems where it appears.

SIGIO (which is not specified in POSIX.1-2001) is ignored by default on
several other UNIX systems.

Where defined, SIGUNUSED is synonymous with SIGSYS  on  most  architec‐
tures.
